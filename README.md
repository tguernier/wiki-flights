# wiki-flights
A one-page HTML map of flights from Auckland Airport (as of December 2025).

This is a vibe coded HTML tool that I summoned into being to test out [Codebuff](https://www.codebuff.com/). Codebuff did all the coding, except for the array of flight information which I got Gemini to scrape directly from the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Airport) as the Codebuff agent hallucinated inaccurate/out-of-date information.

The flight information is hard-coded into the HTML page and probably won't be updated.
